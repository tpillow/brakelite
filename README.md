# Brakelite
A lightweight, minimal, and effective notification system to remind you to stretch
and take quick breaks throughout the day.

## How it Works
Brakelite opens as a system tray icon, and all options can be found in the system
tray drop-down menu.

### Features
- Pre-set notification durations to choose from
- Hard-coded, randomized break messages

### Future Plans
- App/notification icon
- Pre-set notification pause durations to choose from
- Automatic build/release system for executables (Github)
- Customizable (optional) durations/messages/values via a config file
